### Health : Image-based data mining to improve radiotherapy for cancer treatment - Andrew Green. 

Radiotherapy is a treatment for cancer in which radiation is directed into the patient to kill cancerous cells. Unfortunately sometimes the treatment does not work. In this project we will use data from several radiotherapy treatments to try and correlate the radiation dose with, for example, survival/recurrence aiming to improve radiotherapy for future patients. The project will follow the whole process of image-based data mining, including the use of tools to perform image registration and analysis techniques to interrogate the data.
